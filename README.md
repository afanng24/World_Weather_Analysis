**Source of Data** : citipy.py, worldcities.csv, Google Weather API, Open Weather API 

**Software** : Python 3.7.6 , Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code.

##  Summary
  
### WeatherPy_Database
The objective of the challenge is to essentially refactor code we wrote in “VacationPy” and “WeatherPy” to add a description of the weather. In “Weather_Database.ipynb” we created a database that held latitude and longitude, maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, and wind speed. These metrics of measurement were already added in “WeatherPy.ipynb” so all that was needed was to add on a “Current Description” metric.  

### Vacation_Search

“Vacation_Search” is much like “VacationPy” in that we are looking not only for location and weather but also using Google API to look for suitable hotels in the locations we would eventually deem suitable based on weather. The difference once again is the inclusion of a “Current Description”  metric which marks how the weather would be in each given location.
